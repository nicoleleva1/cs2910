Why did I pick this framework?
    I picked this framework because I asked ChatGPT the main differences between the frames and it said that React has a ton of tutorials, which I thought could be useful in the long run. Though, the MDN website provided a ton of detail and walkthrough.

What difficulties did I run into, and was I able to overcome it?
    This side of the project was very simple. There were no difficulties encountered because the walkthrough was very clear and detailed. I did have to step out of my comfort zone though and learn git, which I stayed after and talked to you about(thank you!).

Something entertaining?
    The problem with Git jokes is that everyone has their own version.
    
    Why don't bachelors like Git? 
        Because they are afraid to commit.
