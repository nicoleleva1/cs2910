I liked that there was a step-by-step walkthrough on how to use React. I felt the MDN website was very user and beginner friendly. I did have some issues with their instructinos though. For the most part they were very clear, but at times it would tell you to add a function in a very unspecific spot on the JSX file. There were many times when I either had a blank page, or the error page that shows you JSX file has an error. So I did have to utilize ChatGpt in those situations because I did not know where to put the code.
Either than that it was cool and fun seeing it all come together.
